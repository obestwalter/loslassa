Loslassa Changelog
==================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Loslassa release.

Version 0.3 <2013-04-27>
------------------------

o.k. this is now the first actual version that is somehow usable.

$ cd /path/to/loslassa/project
$ loslassa play

this starts the reloading server and you can start playing

the other commands are still dummies.

Version 0.1-dev-3 <2013-04-27>
------------------------------

Moved example_project into loslassa package hpoing it will turn up in distro.

Version 0.1-dev-2 <2013-04-27>
------------------------------

Came up with a less awkward way to play with it:

$ pip install loslassa
$python

>>> from loslassa.main import main
>>> main()

Version 0.1-dev-1 <2013-04-27>
------------------------------

A local development server and an example project is set up but the script is
not runnable from the installed location yet.

Run loslassa/main.py directly to try it out.
