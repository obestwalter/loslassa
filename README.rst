loslassa

A simple way to generate static web pages with `Python <http://python.org>`_,
`eStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_,
`git <http://git-scm.com>`_, `love <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love>`_ :)

Other important ingredients are the documentation generator
`sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ and some other yet undisclosed tools.

==============
About the name
==============

**loslassa or los lassa** means to let go and relax in
a german dialect called `Swabian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_German>`_
spoken in parts of South Germany. As I moved into this part of Germany in
2011 I came in direct contact with this dialect and I am still quite in
awe of it, but I really like it, so I thought I give my first open source
project a Swabian name :)

Anyway, when I came up with the idea to this project I went to my Yoga class
and my Swabian Yoga teacher always says "loslassa" whenever she wants us to
relax after some contortion she made us go through - so this is my favorite
part of the lessons :)

So in the true spirit of **loslassa** I hope this little project
helps you to let your ideas go in a relaxed and comfortable way.

Nothing fancy.

License

I know, this is really important ... so after thinking long and hard and
consulting squillions of lawyers I decided to put this under the
`DBAD License <http://www.dbad-license.org>`_ ...

Next Steps

Create the basic project structure
==================================

Make it pip installable right away: http://guide.python-distribute.org/creation.html

Basic Ideas
===========

Start locally. Creating a new project initializes a new git repository with the basix structure

Publishing it would clone the repository bare to the web space and set it to be origin from then on.
