About the name
==============

**loslassa or los lassa** means to let go and relax in
a german dialect called `Swabian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_German>`_
spoken in parts of South Germany. As I moved into this part of Germany in
2011 I came in direct contact with this dialect and I am still quite in
awe about it, but I really like it, so I thought I give my first open source
project a Swabian name :)

Anyway, when I came up with the idea to this project I went to my Yoga class
and my Swabian Yoga teacher always says "loslassa" whenever she wants us to
relax after some contortion she made us go through - so this is my favorite
part of the lessons :)

So in the true spirit of **loslassa** I hope this this little project helps to
let your ideas go in a relaxed and comfortable way.

Nothing fancy.
