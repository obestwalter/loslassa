Loslassa
########

A simple way to generate static web pages with `Python <http://python.org>`_,
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_,
`git <http://git-scm.com>`_ and `love <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love>`_ :)

**WARNING**

    **This is just a vague concept atm and serves me as a vehicle to play through**
    **the whole process of getting an open source project in the python**
    **ecosystem on the road - but I reallly hope this will turn into something useful**


Other important ingredients are the documentation generator
`sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ and some other yet undisclosed tools.

==============
About the name
==============

**Loslassa** or **los lassa** means to let go and relax in
a german dialect called `Swabian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_German>`_
spoken in parts of South Germany. As I moved into this part of Germany in
2011 I came in direct contact with this dialect and I am still quite in
awe of it, but I really like it, so I thought I give my first open source
project a Swabian name :)

Anyway, when I came up with the idea to this project I went to my Yoga class
and my Swabian Yoga teacher always says "loslassa" whenever she wants us to
relax after some contortion she made us go through - so this is my favorite
part of the lessons :)

So in the true spirit of **Loslassa** I hope this little project let go of your
preconceptions how static web pages have to be generated and try the Loslassa way :).

License
=======
I know, this is really important ... so after thinking long and hard and
consulting squillions of lawyers I decided to put this world changing project
under the `DBAD License <http://www.dbad-license.org>`_.

==========
Next Steps
==========

Create the basic project structure
==================================

Make it pip installable right away: http://guide.python-distribute.org/creation.html


===========
Basic Ideas
===========

Start locally. Creating a new project initializes a new git repository with the basix structure

Publishing it would clone the repository bare to the web space and set it to be origin from then on.
